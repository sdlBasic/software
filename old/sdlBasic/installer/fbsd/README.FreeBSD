After some work, sdlBasic now works completely on FreeBSD!

For compile sdlBasic on FreeBSD you'll need:
gmake, libsdl, libsdl_mixer, libsdl_image, libsdl_net, libsdl_ttf and smpeg (libsmpeg)
All of these packages are available in the ports collection

Then, if you've installed the packages above,
do:

gmake -f Makefile.fbsd

For install sdlBasic, do:

gmake -f Makefile.fbsd install

clean the sources:

gmake -f Makefile.fbsd clean
