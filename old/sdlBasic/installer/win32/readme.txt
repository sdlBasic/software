for install sdlBasic yuo must be sure to had installed all dll needed.
If you have execute the setup version there are no problem but if you not sure
i suggest to download from site (http://sdlbasic.sf.net) the package (simple zip archive )
that contain all dlls and a batch installer. Please read the incluse instructions!!

WARNING: sdlBasic require the installation of many dlls and Vera fonts!!
before using please install. In installation sdlBasic.exe will be copy in windows directory.
This because if you use with console win dir is in the path...
In this version for problem about software anti-malware target microsoft i for default install in c:\programmi\sdlbasic. this can create problem. I suggest you to read the varius file of installer and study an appropriate modify. All contribute are welcome. Not fear to suggest me a way. i like ti!!!

if your installation is 9x based please install last version
of DirectX and last driver of your graphics card available.
the SdlBasic performance depend of the quality of graphics card
and (in minimal part) the speed of the processor.
Pentium 166mmx is too slow still with a pII 233 with a decent graphics card
can be use.

I had tested with nvidia graphics card (nv200 16mb and nv400) and
with ATI Radeon witout problems.
Still with integrate motherboard chipset viaXXX (not sure of names)
the performace was 50% !!! with a Athlon 2000+!!!!
In another integrated card the performance was good like nvidia.

have also found a pc with a p400 that does not support absolutelly sdlBasic
and in general all sdl based program

I have also tested with windows2000 and i had not problems.

I have received notice with not working about win2000.
I think that problem was font problem.
You must sure that in Windows\fonts directory there are DejaVuSans.ttf and DejaVuSansMono-Roman.ttf
because if missing sdlBasic crash.


Many tank's for Paulo Silva very good collaboration!!!
