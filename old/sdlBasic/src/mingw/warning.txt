for compiling yuo MUST change the path of mingw in mingw.bat
in my system (i have some compiler)the path is:
c:\devel\c-cpp\ming\bin
if in your system (i suppose)are in disk d:
you simple change the addpath line with your mingw path + \bin
in line of compile change include path with your mingw path + \include

you must download all sdl library
for sdl main library download the official mingw library
for others (sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf and sdl_net) i suggest the download of
Sdk for visual c. unpack it and copy lib folder in mingw lib folder and 
include folder in mingw include folder.
If possible i will get in download page of sdlBasic site  a version of mingw 
complete with all need for compiler sdlBasic
