NAME
       freedroid - a free Paradroid clone

SYNOPSIS
       freedroid [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       Freedroid  is  a remake of the classic C64 home computer game Paradroid
       by Andrew Braybrook, including also various extensions.

       The player takes control of the so-called 001 influence device and must
       clear  a freighter of robots by either shooting them or seizing control
       over them.  Seizing control is done in a small logic subgame, in  which
       you  have to connect more electrical connections within 10 seconds than
       your opponent.

OPTIONS
       -v or --version
               Prints out Freedroid version information.

       -q or --nosound
               Suppress all sound output.  Very useful if you don't have  your
               sound  card  configured yet or don't have any sound hardware at
               all.

       -f or --fullscreen
               Work in full screen mode.  Note that fullscreen or window  mode
               can  also be toggled from within the game via the options menu.

       -w or --window
               Start Freedroid in a window rather than using full screen mode.

       -j or --sensitivity
               Control joystick sensitivity. Value must lie in between [0:32].
               Default is 1.

       -d LEVEL or --debug=LEVEL
               Control debug output of the game.  Debug output will be printed
               to  stderr, i.e. in most cases to the console you started Free-
               droid from.  The variable LEVEL controls how much debug  output
               you  would  like  to  have.   LEVEL  0 is the default and means
               (almost) no debug output.  LEVEL 1 prints  the  most  important
               debug  messages and LEVEL 2 or LEVEL 3 print (almost) all debug
               output, which might be quite a lot.

HOW TO PLAY
       Moving and Firing
              The influence device can be moved  inside  the  ship  by  either
              using  keyboard  input or joystick directions.  Keyboard control
              can be done by either using cursor keys or the Quake  and  Half-
              life  style  a-w-s-d  keys  combination.   Firing can be done by
              either using the crosshair and  the  left  mouse  button  or  by
              pressing  a  direction  key and pressing space in addition or by
              holding a joystick direction and pressing a joystick button.
       Entering Elevators and Consoles
              The influence device can move from  one  deck  to  another  deck
              using the elevators of the freighter.  To do this, you must step
              onto an elevator plate, and then either press the e key or press
              the  middle mouse button or appropriate joystick button.  Enter-
              ing consoles is done in  a  similar  way.   You  have  to  stand
              directly in front of a console terminal and then press the e key
              to activate the console.   Inside  the  console  you  will  have
              access  to  a small scale map of the current deck, a side eleva-
              tion of the ship and to the droid database of  the  ship.   Note
              however,  that  access to the droid database is achieved via the
              security clearance of the host you currently control,  i.e.  you
              will  only  be able to view droid data for droids that are lower
              or equal to the host you currently control.
       The takeover subgame (Taking control of other droids)
              To take control of another robot, you must first enter  transfer
              mode.   This  is done by either standing still and holding space
              bar pressed (and keeping space bar  pressed  afterwards)  or  by
              holing  down  the right mouse button or holding town appropriate
              joystick button.  While in takeover mode, the  influence  device
              can  try  to initiate takeover by touching the host it wishes to
              control.  As soon as another robot is touched while in  takeover
              mode,  takeover subgame will be initiated and control of the new
              host will be seized, provided that the takeover subgame is  won.
       Playing the takeover subgame
              After  the takeover subgame was initiated, the two droids strug-
              gling for control will be presented.  Then the  player  gets  to
              decide  which  side  of the takeover game he wants to play.  The
              player on the left side takes the yellow color,  the  player  on
              the right side takes the magenta color.  Note that which side to
              choose may be the most important decision of the  takeover  sub-
              game,  cause  one  side may host strong tactical advantages over
              the other.  After sides have been chosen, the takeover  capsules
              will  be placed.  Each droid has a limited number of capsules to
              place and must try to convert the  central  status  bar  to  his
              color.  The number of capsules you have at your disposal depends
              on the clearance of the host you currently  control.   Once  the
              takeover  subgame  is won, the player will have control over the
              new bot while the old host is destroyed.  Control over  the  new
              host  also  means  inheriting  the  movement  properties and the
              weapons of this robot.  Loss of takeover subgame results in  the
              current  host,  if one is present, being destroyed or the influ-
              ence itself being  burnt  out  and  destroyed  if  no  host  was
              present.
       Notes on energy loss
              The  influence device depends on hosts to control.  Whether cur-
              rently controlling a host or  not,  the  influence  device  will
              always  lose energy due to construction properties.  When taking
              control of a new host, the influence device will also take  con-
              trol  of the energy this droid had left, which will be even more
              the higher the bot you take control of.  However, higher  droids
              also  tend  to put up more resistance against the control of the
              influence device, resulting in faster loss of energy.  Therefore
              it  is  recommended  to change hosts frequently in order to keep
              the influence device well powered.  Note  that  there  are  some
              refresh  field,  where  some  of  the  energy lost so far can be
              restored.  But note also, that only energy loss  due  to  colli-
              sions, explosions and enemy fire can be restored this way, while
              energy loss due to host resistance is permanently lost until the
              host is changed again.
