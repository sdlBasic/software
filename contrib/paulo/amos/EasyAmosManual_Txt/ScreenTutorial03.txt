'Set up a double buffered screen

Screen Open 0,320,200,16,Lowres
Curs Off 
Double Buffer 
'
'Set Autoback 0 - This means we have to do the screen swapping 
'
Autoback 0
X=2 : Y=2
'
'Main loop 
'
ML:
'
'Call a procedure which draws a box and fills it in with Red colour
'
PLT[X,Y]
'
'Because the box was drawn onto the LOGICAL screen we cannot yet see it. 
'So we now ask Easy AMOS to swap the PHYSICAL screen over for the LOGICAL
'screen. 
'
Screen Swap 
'  
'Even though we've asked for a screen swap it wont actually happen until 
'the next vertical blank. So we have to slow our program down to wait for
'this to happen. 
'
Wait Vbl 
'
'Now that the screens have been switched, we must draw the same box onto 
'the new LOGICAL screen. Otherwise a flashing effect will mess up our
'screen. You can see this by removing the line PLT[X,Y] below. 
'
PLT[X,Y]
Screen Swap 
Wait Vbl 
'
'Now we update the coordinates of the box so that it will be displayed 
'at a different postion next time in the loop. 
'
X=X+10 : Y=Y+10
'
'Check to see if the last box has been drawn, if not jump back to the top
'of the main Loop  
'
If X<180 Then Goto ML
'
'This is the small procedure which draws the box and fills it.

Procedure PLT[X,Y]
   Ink 5
   Box X,Y To X+20,Y+20
