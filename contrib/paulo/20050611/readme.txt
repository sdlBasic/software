Combat-clone made on sdlBasic simulating a MSX1 machine
sketch planned to be converted to MSX-asm

keys:

F2- reset
Esc- quit

WSAD- moves player 1 forward and back, and turns left and right
Z- player 1 shot

TGFH- moves player 2 forward and back, and turns left and right
V- player 2 shot

IKJL- moves player 3 forward and back, and turns left and right
M- player 3 shot

Cursor keys- moves player 4 forward and back, and turns left and right

to do:
- barriers being real obstacles for tanks and shots
- more game and championship modes
- game score (?)
- tanks exploding when hit (sprites 48 to 62 are free for this...)
- porting to asm-msx1


running the game:
- Combat_4players_05.sdlbas - It needs sdlBasic (http://sdlbasic.sourceforge.net)
- Depending on the operative system used, .sdlbas script documents can be associated to the sdlBasic executable application, or by command line (console, prompt, etc.)
- sdlBasic is open-source, and ported to Linux, w32, MacOS-X, BSD, MorphOS, AmigaOS-4, and the list is growing (BeOS, ArOS and OS2 are still missing)
